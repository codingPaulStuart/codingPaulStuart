### Hi there, I am Paul StuartðŸ‘‹ Software Graduate Adelaide TAFE. January Piscine Bootcamp at Adelaide 42, current student at the 42 School. Love to copy other people's code then say its mine! Engineering Software is way cool as is basketball, climbing big rocks, heavy metal and my amazing family.
